<sup>(*) Coqui TTS models are only available on x86-64</sup>

Language models can be downloaded directly from the app.

Details of models which are currently configured for download are described in
[models.json (GitHub)](https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote/blob/main/config/models.json) or
[models.json (GitLab)](https://gitlab.com/mkiol/dsnote/-/blob/main/config/models.json).

## Contributions

Any contribution is very welcome!

Project is hosted both on [GitHub](https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mkiol/dsnote).
Feel free to make a PR/MR, report an issue or reqest for new feature on the platform you prefer the most.

### Translation

Translation files in Qt format are in [translations dir (GitHub)](https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote/tree/main/translations) or
[translations dir (GitLab)](https://gitlab.com/mkiol/dsnote/-/tree/main/translations).

Preferred way to contribute translation is via [Transifex service](https://explore.transifex.com/mkiol/dsnote/),
but if you would like to make a direct PR/MR, please do it.

## Download

- Linux Desktop: [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/net.mkiol.SpeechNote)
- Sailfish OS: [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/mkiol/speech-note)

## Building from sources

### Linux

Following tools/libraries are required for building (example of packages for Ubuntu 22.04):
`build-essential` `cmake` `git` `autoconf` `qtbase5-dev` `qtdeclarative5-dev`
`qtmultimedia5-dev` `qtquickcontrols2-5-dev` `python3-dev` `zlib1g-dev` `libtool`
`libboost-all-dev`.

```
git clone <git repository url>

cd dsnote
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_DESKTOP=ON
make
```

In a runtime app requires following Qt QML modules (example of packages for Ubuntu 22.04): `qml-module-qtquick-controls` `qml-module-qtquick-dialogs` `qml-module-qtquick-controls2` `qml-module-qtquick-layouts`.

Also to make Python components work (i.e.: 'Coqui TTS models', 'Restore punctuation' feature), following Python libriaries have to be installed (pip packages names): `torch` `torchaudio` `transformers` `accelerate` `TTS`.

To make build without support for Python components, add `-DWITH_PY=OFF` in cmake step.

### Flatpak

```
git clone <git repository url>

cd dsnote/flatpak

flatpak-builder --user --install-deps-from=flathub --repo="/path/to/local/flatpak/repo" "/path/to/output/dir" net.mkiol.SpeechNote.yaml

```

### Sailfish OS

```
git clone <git repository url>

cd dsnote
mkdir build
cd build

sfdk config --session specfile=../sfos/harbour-dsnote.spec
sfdk config --session target=SailfishOS-4.4.0.58-aarch64
sfdk cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_SFOS=ON
sfdk package
```
