    <release version="4.8.0" date="2025-03-15">
      <description>
      <p>User Interface:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Speech Note has been translated into Arabic, Catalan, Spanish and French-Canadian languages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Text to Speech:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Parler TTS engine. Parler TTS can generate high-quality, natural sounding speech in the style of a given speaker (gender, pitch, speaking style, etc).
          The speaker's characteristics are defined by a text description (prompt).
          Parler TTS primarily supports English, but a multilingual model for French, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, German, Dutch and Italian is also included.</li>
      <li>S.A.M. TTS engine. S.A.M. is a small speech synthesizer designed for the Commodore 64.
          It features a robotic voice that evokes a strong sense of nostalgia.
          The S.A.M. voice is available in English only.</li>
      <li>'Normalize audio' setting option.
          Use this option to enable/disable audio volume normalization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speech to Text:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>New 'CrisperWhisper' model for 'FasterWhisper' engine.
          CrisperWhisper is designed for fast, precise, and verbatim speech recognition with accurate word-level timestamps.
          Unlike the original Whisper, which tends to omit disfluencies and follows more of a intended transcription style,
          CrisperWhisper aims to transcribe every spoken word exactly as it is, including fillers, pauses, stutters and false starts.
          CrisperWhisper model is enabled only for English and German languages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Translator:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>New models: English to Chinese, English to Arabic, English to Korean, English to Japanese</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Accessibility:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Support for 'Insert into active window' under Wayland.
          Using 'start-listening-active-window' or 'start-listening-translate-active-window'
          actions you can directly insert the decoded text into any window which is currently in focus.
          This feature worked under X11 only but now it is also suppored under Wayland.
          For actions to work, 'ydotool' daemon must be installed and running.</li>
      <li>Support for 'Global keyboard shortcuts' under Wayland.
          Until now, this capability was only available under X11.
          Now integration with 'XDG Desktop Portal' has been added, making global keyboard shortcuts possible also under Wayland.
          For shortcuts to work, your desktop enviroment has to support
          'GlobalShortcuts' interface on 'XDG Desktop Portal' service.</li>
      </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="4.7.1" date="2025-01-05">
      <description>
      <p>General:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Fix: The application failed to start when the processor did not support AVX CPU extension.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Translator:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>New models: Korean to English, Japanese to English</li>
      <li>Updated models: Chinese to English</li>
      </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="4.7.0" date="2024-12-28">
      <description>
      <p>General:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Rules for text transformations that can be applied after Speech to Text or before Text to Speech.
          With Rules, you can easily and flexibly correct errors in decoded text or correct mispronounced words.</li>
      <li>New modes for inserting text at the cursor position or replacing the current note.
          To insert text at the cursor position rather than at the end of the note,
          change 'Text appending mode' option to 'Add at the cursor position' in the settings.
          When the 'Replace an existing note' option is set, whenever new text is added, it will replace the existing note.</li>
      <li>DBus API for integration with external applications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>User Interface:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Speech Note has been translated into Slovenian language.</li>
      <li>Status indication in the system tray icon.
          When using the system tray icon, statuses such as processing, listening, etc. are presented with an animated tray icon.</li>
      <li>Models grouped by type in model browser.
          To improve usability, instead of a list containing models of all types, models are grouped by type in separate tabs.</li>
      <li>Command line options for printing available or active model.</li>
      <li>Command line option to print the current status of the application.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speech to Text:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Support for Vulkan GPU acceleration in 'WhisperCpp'.
          Vulkan acceleration enables much faster STT decoding with Intel, AMD or NVIDIA graphics cards.
          The biggest advantage of Vulkan is that you can use it without installing any GPU acceleration add-ons.</li>
      <li>New 'Whisper Large Turbo' model for both 'WhisperCpp' and 'FasterWhisper'.
          Turbo is a finetuned version of a pruned 'Whisper Large-v3'. It's the exact same model,
          except that the number of decoding layers have reduced. As a result, the model is way faster,
          at the expense of a minor quality degradation.</li>
      <li>Simplified engine configuration options. Instead of multiple options, you can now select a Profile,
          which allows you to change the engine's processing parameters.
          There are three profiles to choose from: 'Best Performance', 'Best Quality' and 'Custom'.</li>
      <li>Echo mode. After processing, the decoded text will be immediately read out using the currently set Text to Speech model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Text to Speech:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>New 'Piper' voice for Latvian</li>
      <li>New 'WhisperSpeech Small' model for: English, Italian, German, French, Spanish, Dutch and Portuguese</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Translator:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>New models: English to Finnish, English to Turkish, English to Swedish, Swedish to English,
          English to Slovak, English to Indonesian, English to Romanian, English to Greek, Chinese to English</li>
      <li>Updated models: English to Catalan, English to Russian, English to Ukrainian, English to Czech</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Accessibility:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Option to scan special keystrokes when setting keyboard shortcuts (X11 only).
          If you want to use special keys as shortcuts (so-called multimedia keys),
          instead of typing their name, you can automatically set the key by pressing it.</li>
      <li>Keyboard shortcuts enabled for several user interface elements.
          Elements such as menu items or buttons can be controlled using the keyboard shortcuts.</li>
      <li>New 'Actions' and global keyboard shortcut to force translation of text in STT:
          'start-listening-translate', 'start-listening-translate-active-window', 'start-listening-translate-clipboard'.
          The decoded text is always translated into English when the "translate" action is triggered.
          This only works when using Whisper models.</li>
      <li>New 'Action' to read text from the command-line option: 'start-reading-text'.
          To pass text, use the '--text' option in the command-line interface.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Flatpak:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>whisper.cpp update to version 1.7.1</li>
      <li>PyTorch update to version 2.5.1</li>
      <li>The Flatpak GPU acceleration add-on for AMD is no longer recommended.
          Better results can be achieved with Vulkan acceleration, which does not require the add-on.</li>
      </ul>
      </description>

    <release version="4.6.0" date="2024-07-28">
      <description>
      <p>User Interface:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Speech Note has been translated into Norwegian language.</li>
      <li>Grouped models.
          Models that provide multiple sub-models (for example, TTS models that provide different voices)
          are shown in groups. This makes it easier to find models in the model browser.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speech to Text:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The name of the all Whisper models has been changed to 'WhisperCpp' to better reflect the engine behind them.
          Whisper is currently supported by the 'WhisperCpp' and 'FasterWhisper' engines.
          Both engines are optimized to achieve the best performance.</li>
      <li>Automatic language detection in STT.
          To automatically detect the language during STT, select one of the models that is in the 'Auto detected'
          category in the language list.</li>
      <li>Separate settings for engines.
          The configuration of each engine has been separated in the settings.
          You can separately set the parameters for 'WhisperCpp' and 'FasterWhisper'.
          The new configuration parameters that have been added to the settings are:
          'Number of simultaneous threads', 'Beam search width',
          'Audio context size', 'Use Flash Attention'.</li>
      <li>Quicker decoding with 'WhisperCpp'.
          Optimization for short sentences has been added to 'WhisperCpp' engine. With it, the speed of STT has doubled!</li>
      <li>Support for OpenVINO hardware acceleration in 'WhisperCpp.
          With OpenVINO decoding on CPU is much quicker. If you are not using GPU acceleration,
          it is recommended to enable OpenVINO in 'WhisperCpp' engine settings.
          Currently, OpenVINO is enabled only for CPU acceleration.</li>
      <li>Option for inserting processing statistics.
          New settings option allows inserting processing related information to the text after decoding,
          such as processing time and audio length. This can be useful for comparing the performance of different models,
          engines and their parameters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Text to Speech:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Control tags for advance TTS processing.
          Control tags allow you to dynamically change the speed of synthesized text or add silence between sentences.
          To use control tags, insert '{speed: 0.5}' or '{silence: 1s}' into the text.
          For convenience, you can also insert predefined control tags using text context menu 'Insert control tag'.</li>
      <li>Welsh language. New language is enabled with 'Piper' voice.</li>
      <li>New 'Piper' voices for Spanish, Italian and English</li>

      <p>Speech to Text:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Improved AMD GPU acceleration support for Whisper models.
          Whisper GPU accelerator for AMD cards uses OpenCL interface.
          OpenCL implementation shipped in Flatpak runtime 'Clover'
          does not support new AMD cards.
          To overcome this problem, Speech Note package provides another
          implementation of OpenCL 'ROCm-OpenCL' which supports new AMD hardware.</li>
